        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m Stratton Brooks, iâ€™m a Native American in tech. Iâ€™m currently finishing up my studies at Holberton Schoolâ€“a peer learning computer science program. Iâ€™ve spent the past year studying 70-80 hours a week, learning how to program for augmented and virtual reality systems.</p>

        <p>
          I chose this path because of the joy I see when people use XR products for the first time, and if I had a career where I helped contribute to that joy then I'd feel fulfilled.         </p>
        <p>So far, my biggest professional accomplishment is passing my exam to be certified by Unity for game development. </p>
        <p>Currently, iâ€™m looking for a software engineer position in the XR space. I enjoy working with C#/ Unity and WebXR/Javascript. I plan to pick up C++ this year and learn Unreal.</p>
